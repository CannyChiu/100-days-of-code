# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1 (Dec 26, 2023)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Odin Project requires us to set-up a virtual machine so I've learned how that works in practice

**Thoughts:** Getting familiar with BASH scripts. Useful context!

### Day 2 (Dec 27, 2023)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed my knowledge of Git and Github, set up the integration between the 2. Downloaded Ruby via CLI.

**Thoughts:** It was alot of extra learning of how to properly integrate Git and Github, but I'm excited that I've refamiliarized myself with both.

### Day 3 (Dec 28, 2023)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Refreshed knowledge of strings, floats, decimals, math operations in Ruby. Re-introduced to basic data structures like Hash/key values pairs and indexes. Ran Rspec via CLI.

**Thoughts:** Lots of similar foundations as when I was working on Javascript, it's easier to conceptualize everything since I've learned most of this before

### Day 4 (Dec 30, 2023)
##### 

**Today's Progress**: Freshed the basics of combining HTML and CSS (External CSS, Internal CSS and inline CSS). Went through basic CSS code to change properties (colors, font families, etc).

**Thoughts:** Another refresher class on front-end basics, feeling more  confident in coding again. Feeling more comfortable with CLI/Linux commands to navigate file directories
